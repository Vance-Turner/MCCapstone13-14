Here $\\dot{m}$ is the time derivative of mass flowing through the turbine, $v$ is the air velocity, $\\rho$ is the density of the air, and $A$ is the cross sectional area of the wind turbine.

      "                Some theory blah blah blah: <b>Basic Momentum Theory Model</b> The wind turbine in the diffuser simply causes a pressure drop from the intlet of the diffuser to the exit. The derivation results in $p_2-p_1=4a(1-a){1\\over 2\\rho V_0^2}$ where $a$ is the axial induction factor which is the ratio of the change in the wind speed far away to the wind sped at the blade over the wind speed far away. It results from the wind being deflected around the blades. It is: $a={U_1-U_2\\over U_1}$ where $U_1$ is the wind speed far away and $U_2$ is the wind speed at the blades. We notice that this is independent of diffuser area ratio, the back pressure ratio, and the location of the turbine inside the diffuser! The importance though of the shroud is noticed by the increase in wind velocity at the inlet: $v_1=\\beta \\gamma (1-a)V_0$ where $\\beta$ is the diffuser area ratio (the ratio of the outle to the inlet of the cross-sectional area) and the $\\gamma$ is the negative back pressure. Thus we have more wind coming into the diffuser and thus more power. The theory developed then says that the thrust on the rotor is not dependent on the extra mass flow. When we compare the basic momentum theory model to the results of Grumman Aerospace experiments the model does quite well.\n",

      "                Conclusions as of 2007: Applying simple momentum theory we can see that energy extracted per unit of wind is the same with or without the shroud. The increase in maximum performance is due to the mass flow. It goes with the geometric area ratio $\\beta$ between nozzle and exit. Extra back pressure allows us to go beyond the maximum power coefficient which is equal to the Betz maximum: ${16\\over 27}$. <b>Power coefficients have not gone above 0.5.</b> If we reduce back pressure, we can increase performance; but this comes at a cost of high diffuser area ratio's. $\\beta>4.5$. <b>So far no one has combined a large value for backpressure and significant mass flow augmentation</b>\n",
